        Args:
            interval (PaymentScheduleInterval):
            interval_execution_day (int): The day of the interval on which to schedule the payment.  If the payment interval is weekly, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).  If the payment interval is monthly, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer indicating which day of the month to make the payment on. Integers from 1 to 28 can be used to make a payment on that day of the month. Negative integers from -1 to -5 can be used to make a payment relative to the end of the month. To make a payment on the last day of the month, use -1; to make the payment on the second-to-last day, use -2, and so on.
            start_date (date): A date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Standing order payments will begin on the first `interval_execution_day` on or after the `start_date`.  If the first `interval_execution_day` on or after the start date is also the same day that `/payment_initiation/payment/create` was called, the bank *may* make the first payment on that day, but it is not guaranteed to do so.

        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the
                                composed schema that is
                                is traveled through is added to this set.
                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in
                                _visited_composed_classes = (Animal,)
            adjusted_start_date (date, none_type): The start date sent to the bank after adjusting for holidays or weekends.  Will be provided in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). If the start date did not require adjustment, this field will be `null`.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            end_date (date): A date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Standing order payments will end on the last `interval_execution_day` on or before the `end_date`.  If the only `interval_execution_day` between the start date and the end date (inclusive) is also the same day that `/payment_initiation/payment/create` was called, the bank *may* make a payment on that day, but it is not guaranteed to do so..
